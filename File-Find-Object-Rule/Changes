--------------------------------------

0.0310  2019-04-05
    - Fully qualified shebang for findorule (thanks to mageia linux)
    - Enable tidyall in dist.ini.

0.0309  2018-06-20
    - Remove stray *.orig files from the CPAN dist.
        - Thanks to gregor .

0.0308  2018-06-19
    - Apply spelling fixes patch from Debian
        - https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=125635
        - Thanks!

0.0307  2018-05-23
    - Convert to Dist-Zilla .

0.0306  2016-09-11
    - Made the trailing space tests AUTHOR_TESTING only.
        - We received a report that there was a circular dependency on
        Test::TrailingSpace and while this is not an issue and was caused by
        the reporter's use-case (that was irrational in my opinion), this change
        was done to avoid future reports like that.

0.0305  2014-05-18
    - Made the tests succeed if run in parallel (e.g:
    HARNESS_OPTIONS="j4:c" ).

0.0304  2014-01-29
    - Add a separate LICENSE file (CPANTS Kwalitee).
    - Specify minimal version of Perl as 5.8.x (CPANTS Kwalitee).

0.0303  2013-05-27
    - Remove trailing space.
    - Remove Makefile.PL - use Build.PL from now on.

0.0302  2012-12-25
    - Update the repository URL.
    - Link to the Path::Class::Rule overview of directory traversal
    modules on the POD.
    - The “Evil Reindeer Evil Christmas Evil Conspiracy” Release. ;-)

0.0301  2012-04-23
    - Made ->start() return itself. Bug was reported here:
        - http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.beginners/2012/04/msg120670.html
        - it previously returned only 1.
        - Add a test for ->start() for the next time.

0.0300  2009-06-26
    - Adapted the README to File-Find-Object-Rule.
    - Added POD tests and got to full POD coverage.
    - Converted many direct $self->{$field} accesses to Class::XSAccessor
    accessors.
    - Now ->start() and ->match() are iteration-enabled.
        - ->start() no longer calls ->in() but the other way around, making
        use of File::Find::Object's power.
    - Added resources and keywords information to the Build.PL
    - Updated lib/File/Find/Object/Rule/Extending.pod for
    File-Find-Object-Rule .

0.0200  2009-03-01
    - hopefully got rid of all UNIXisms (and incompatibilities with Win32), and
    problems such as running when having temporary files (*~) in the test
    files:
        - now holding a pristine copy of the test tree under
            ./t/sample-data/to-copy-from/
        and copying it and processing it using File::Find::Object::TreeCreate
        which was borrowed from the File::Find::Object code.
        - Converted all the paths constant to variables, which are generated
        using $tree_creator->get_path().
        - Removed some non-portable assertions or ones that are hard to
        reproduce with File::Spec.
        - Added Test::Count annotations to the tests' code.

0.0101  2009-02-22
    - fixed the dependencies in Build.PL (especially File::Find::Object)
    - moved findrule to scripts/findorule

0.0100  2009-02-18
    - first release on CPAN - a direct port of File-Find-Rule-0.30
    to File::Find::Object.
