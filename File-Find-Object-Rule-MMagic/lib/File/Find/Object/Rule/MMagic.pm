=head1 NAME

File::Find::Object::Rule::MMagic - rule to match on mime types

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use File::Find::Object::Rule::MMagic;
 my @images = find( file => magic => 'image/*', in => '.' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

File::Find::Object::Rule::MMagic interfaces L<File::MMagic> to 
L<File::Find::Object::Rule> enabling you to find files based upon their mime 
type.  L<Text::Glob> is used so that the pattern may be a simple globbing 
pattern.

=head2 ->magic( @patterns )

Match only things with the mime types specified by @patterns.  The
specification can be a glob pattern, as provided by L<Text::Glob>.
