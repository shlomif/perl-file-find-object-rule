=head1 NAME

File::Find::Object - A File::Find object oriented

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use File::Find::Object;
    my $tree = File::Find::Object->new({}, @dir);

    while (my $r = $tree->next()) {
        print $r ."\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

File::Find::Object does same job the File::Find but unlike him, works
like an object and with an iterator. As File::Find is not object oriented you
can't perform multiple search in same application. The second problem of
File::Find is its file processing, after starting its main loop, you can't
easilly wait another event an so get next result.

With File::Find::Object you get next file by calling next() functions, but
setting a callback is still possible.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 new

    my $ffo = File::Find::Object->new( { options }, @files);

Create a new File::Find::Object object. @files is the list of directory
- or files - the object should explore.

=head3 options

=over 4

=item depth

Boolean, return the directory content before the directory itself

=item nocrossfs

Boolean, don't continue on filesystem different than the parent

=item followlink

Boolean, follow symlink when they point to a directory.

You can safelly set this options, File::Find::Object does not follow the link
if detect a loop.

=item filter

Function, should point to a function returning TRUE or FALSE. This function is
call with the filename to filter, if the function return FALSE, the file is
skiped.

=item callback

Function, should point to a function calle each time a new file is return. The
function is called with the current filename as argument.

=back

=head2 next

Return the next file find by the File::Find::Object, it return undef at end.

=head2 item

Return the current filename found by the File::Find::Object object, aka the
latest value return by next().

=head1 BUGS

Currently works only on UNIX as it use '/' as separator.
